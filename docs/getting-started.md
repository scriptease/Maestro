This guide gets you from install to a first productive session with Maestro.

## 1. Install and launch

Follow the [Installation](./installation) instructions for your platform, then launch Maestro.

## 2. Create an agent (or use the Wizard)

Maestro supports **Claude Code**, **Codex** (OpenAI), and **OpenCode** as providers. Make sure at least one is installed and authenticated.

<Note>
Maestro is a pass-through to your provider. Your MCP tools, custom skills, permissions, and authentication all work in Maestro exactly as they do when running the provider directly. The only difference is batch mode execution—Maestro sends a prompt and receives a response rather than running an interactive session.
</Note>

**Option A: Quick Setup**
Create your first agent manually using the **+** button in the sidebar.

**Option B: Onboarding Wizard** (Recommended for new users)
Press `Cmd+Shift+N` / `Ctrl+Shift+N` to launch the **Onboarding Wizard**, which guides you through:

1. Selecting an AI provider
2. Choosing your project directory
3. Having a discovery conversation where the AI learns about your project
4. Generating an initial Auto Run Playbook with tasks

![Wizard Document Generation](./screenshots/wizard-doc-generation.png)

The Wizard creates a fully configured agent with an Auto Run document folder ready to go. Generated documents are saved to an `Initiation/` subfolder within `.maestro/playbooks/` to keep them organized separately from documents you create later.

### Introductory Tour

After completing the Wizard, you'll be offered an **Introductory Tour** that highlights key UI elements:

- The AI Terminal and how to interact with it
- The Auto Run panel and how document processing works
- File Explorer and preview features
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

You can skip the tour and access it later via **Quick Actions** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) → "Start Tour".

## 3. Open a project

Point your new agent at a project directory. Maestro will detect git repos automatically and enable git-aware features like diffs, logs, and worktrees.

## 4. Start a conversation

Use the **AI Terminal** to talk with your AI provider, and the **Command Terminal** for shell commands. Toggle between them with `Cmd+J` / `Ctrl+J`. Each tab in the AI Terminal is a separate session.

## 5. Try Auto Run

Create a markdown checklist, then run it through Auto Run to see the spec-driven workflow in action. See [Auto Run + Playbooks](./autorun-playbooks) for a full walkthrough.
