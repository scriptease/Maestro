description: Complete YAML schema reference for .maestro/cue.yaml configuration files.
icon: file-code
---

Cue is configured via a `.maestro/cue.yaml` file placed inside the `.maestro/` directory at your project root. The engine watches this file for changes and hot-reloads automatically.

## File Location

```
your-project/
├── .maestro/
│   └── cue.yaml        # Cue configuration
├── src/
├── package.json
└── ...
```

Maestro discovers this file automatically when the Cue Encore Feature is enabled. Each agent that has a `.maestro/cue.yaml` in its project root gets its own independent Cue engine instance.

## Full Schema

```yaml
# Pipeline comment — groups subscriptions into a named pipeline in the UI
# Pipeline: My Pipeline (color: #06b6d4)

# Subscriptions define trigger-prompt pairings
subscriptions:
  - name: string # Required. Unique identifier for this subscription
    event: string # Required. Event type (see Event Types)
    enabled: boolean # Optional. Default: true
    prompt: string # Required (or use prompt_file). Inline prompt text
    prompt_file: string # Required (or use prompt). Path to a .md file
    output_prompt: string # Optional. Follow-up prompt sent after the main run completes
    output_prompt_file: string # Optional. Path to a .md file for the output prompt
    label: string # Optional. Human-readable label displayed in the Cue dashboard
    agent_id: string # Optional. UUID of the target agent

    # Event-specific fields
    interval_minutes: number # Required for time.heartbeat
    schedule_times: list # Required for time.scheduled (HH:MM strings)
    schedule_days: list # Optional for time.scheduled (mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun)
    watch: string # Required for file.changed, task.pending (glob pattern)
    source_session: string | list # Required for agent.completed
    fan_out: list # Optional. Target session names for fan-out
    filter: object # Optional. Payload field conditions
    repo: string # Optional for github.* (auto-detected if omitted)
    poll_minutes: number # Optional for github.*, task.pending

# Global settings (all optional — sensible defaults applied)
settings:
  timeout_minutes: number # Default: 30. Max run duration before timeout
  timeout_on_fail: string # Default: 'break'. What to do on timeout: 'break' or 'continue'
  max_concurrent: number # Default: 1. Simultaneous runs (1-10)
  queue_size: number # Default: 10. Max queued events (0-50)
```

## Subscriptions

Each subscription is a trigger-prompt pairing. When the trigger fires, Cue sends the prompt to the agent.

| `label`              | string          | —       | Human-readable label displayed in the Cue dashboard and pipeline editor     |

### Prompt Field

Prompts can be provided inline or via a separate file.

**Inline prompt:**

```yaml
prompt: |
  Please lint the file {{CUE_FILE_PATH}} and fix any errors.
```

**File reference (using `prompt_file`):**

```yaml
prompt_file: .maestro/prompts/my-prompt.md
```

File paths are resolved relative to the project root. Prompt files support the same `{{VARIABLE}}` template syntax as inline prompts. Using `prompt_file` keeps your `cue.yaml` clean when prompts are long or complex — the Pipeline Editor uses this approach by default, storing prompt files in `.maestro/prompts/`.

### Output Prompt (Two-Phase Runs)

The `output_prompt` field enables a two-phase execution pattern. When the main `prompt` completes successfully, Cue automatically sends the `output_prompt` as a follow-up — with the first run's output included as context.

This is useful for workflows where one phase generates data and a second phase acts on it:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: test-and-report
    event: time.heartbeat
    interval_minutes: 60
    prompt: |
      Run the full test suite with `npm test` and capture the results.
    output_prompt: |
      Based on the test results above, generate a summary report.
      Include pass/fail counts and highlight any regressions.
```

You can also use `output_prompt_file` to reference a `.md` file instead of inline text:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: analyze-and-summarize
    event: file.changed
    watch: 'src/**/*.ts'
    prompt: Analyze {{CUE_FILE_PATH}} for code quality issues.
    output_prompt_file: prompts/summarize-analysis.md
```

<Note>
The output prompt only fires when the main run completes successfully. If the main run times out or fails, the output phase is skipped.
</Note>

### Pipelines

A **pipeline** groups multiple subscriptions under a single name in the Pipeline Editor. This is useful when you have related automations (e.g., a daily scan and a weekly review) that logically belong together.

**Defining a pipeline:**

Add a pipeline comment at the top of your `cue.yaml`, then use a naming convention to group subscriptions:

```yaml
# Pipeline: My Pipeline (color: #06b6d4)

subscriptions:
  - name: My Pipeline
    event: time.scheduled
    schedule_times:
      - '09:00'
    prompt_file: .maestro/prompts/my-pipeline-daily.md

  - name: My Pipeline-chain-1
    event: time.scheduled
    schedule_times:
      - '17:00'
    prompt_file: .maestro/prompts/my-pipeline-eod.md
```

**How it works:**

1. The `# Pipeline: Name (color: hex)` comment declares the pipeline name and its color in the UI
2. The first subscription's `name` matches the pipeline name exactly
3. Additional subscriptions in the same pipeline use the convention `Name-chain-N` (e.g., `My Pipeline-chain-1`, `My Pipeline-chain-2`)
4. All subscriptions with matching names appear as separate trigger lines within a single pipeline in the Pipeline Editor

**Notes:**

- The `color` in the comment sets the pipeline's dot color in the UI (any valid hex color)
- Each subscription in a pipeline can have its own event type, schedule, and prompt — they don't need to share configuration
- Use the `label` field to give each line a descriptive name (e.g., "Daily Analysis", "Weekly Review")
- The Pipeline Editor creates this structure automatically when you use the visual editor

### Labels

The `label` field provides a human-readable name displayed in the Cue dashboard and pipeline editor. When subscriptions are grouped into a pipeline, the label distinguishes each line within the pipeline.

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: pr-review
    label: 'PR Review Bot'
    event: github.pull_request
    prompt: Review the PR at {{CUE_GH_URL}}.
```

### Disabling Subscriptions

Set `enabled: false` to pause a subscription without deleting it:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: nightly-report
    event: time.heartbeat
    interval_minutes: 1440
    enabled: false # Paused — won't fire until re-enabled
    prompt: Generate a daily summary report.
```

## Settings

The optional `settings` block configures global engine behavior. All fields have sensible defaults — you only need to include settings you want to override.

### timeout_minutes

**Default:** `30` | **Type:** positive number

Maximum duration (in minutes) for a single Cue-triggered run. If an agent takes longer than this, the run is terminated.

```yaml
settings:
  timeout_minutes: 60 # Allow up to 1 hour per run
```

### timeout_on_fail

**Default:** `'break'` | **Type:** `'break'` or `'continue'`

What happens when a run times out:

- **`break`** — Stop the run and mark it as failed. No further processing for this event.
- **`continue`** — Stop the run but allow downstream subscriptions (in fan-in chains) to proceed with partial data.

```yaml
settings:
  timeout_on_fail: continue # Don't block the pipeline on slow agents
```

### max_concurrent

**Default:** `1` | **Type:** integer, 1–10

Maximum number of Cue-triggered runs that can execute simultaneously for this agent. Additional events are queued.

```yaml
settings:
  max_concurrent: 3 # Allow up to 3 parallel runs
```

### queue_size

**Default:** `10` | **Type:** integer, 0–50

Maximum number of events that can be queued when all concurrent slots are occupied. Events beyond this limit are dropped.

Set to `0` to disable queueing — events that can't run immediately are discarded.

```yaml
settings:
  queue_size: 20 # Buffer up to 20 events
```

## Validation

The engine validates your YAML on every load. Common validation errors:

| Error                                   | Fix                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"name" is required`                    | Every subscription needs a unique `name` field               |
| `"event" is required`                   | Specify one of the nine event types                          |
| `"prompt" is required`                  | Provide inline text or a file path                           |
| `"interval_minutes" is required`        | `time.heartbeat` events must specify a positive interval     |
| `"schedule_times" is required`          | `time.scheduled` events must have at least one `HH:MM` time  |
| `"watch" is required`                   | `file.changed` and `task.pending` events need a glob pattern |
| `"source_session" is required`          | `agent.completed` events need the name of the source agent   |
| `"max_concurrent" must be between 1-10` | Keep concurrent runs within the allowed range                |
| `"queue_size" must be between 0-50`     | Keep queue size within the allowed range                     |
| `filter key must be string/number/bool` | Filter values only accept primitive types                    |

The inline YAML editor in the Cue Modal shows validation errors in real-time as you type. A green **Valid YAML** indicator at the bottom confirms your config parses correctly.

## Complete Example

A realistic configuration demonstrating a pipeline with multiple trigger lines, mixed event types, and external prompt files:

```yaml
# Pipeline: DevOps (color: #10b981)

subscriptions:
  # Lint TypeScript files on save
  - name: DevOps
    label: Lint on Save
    event: file.changed
    watch: 'src/**/*.ts'
    filter:
      extension: '.ts'
    prompt: |
      The file {{CUE_FILE_PATH}} was modified.
      Run `npx eslint {{CUE_FILE_PATH}} --fix` and report any remaining issues.

  # Morning standup on weekdays
  - name: DevOps-chain-1
    label: Morning Standup
    event: time.scheduled
    schedule_times:
      - '09:00'
    schedule_days:
      - mon
      - tue
      - wed
      - thu
      - fri
    prompt: |
      Generate a standup report from recent git activity.

  # Review new PRs automatically
  - name: DevOps-chain-2
    label: PR Review
    event: github.pull_request
    poll_minutes: 3
    filter:
      draft: false
    prompt: |
      A new PR needs review: {{CUE_GH_TITLE}} (#{{CUE_GH_NUMBER}})
      Author: {{CUE_GH_AUTHOR}}
      Branch: {{CUE_GH_BRANCH}} -> {{CUE_GH_BASE_BRANCH}}
      URL: {{CUE_GH_URL}}

      {{CUE_GH_BODY}}

      Please review this PR for code quality, potential bugs, and style issues.

  # Work on pending tasks from TODO.md
  - name: DevOps-chain-3
    label: Task Worker
    event: task.pending
    watch: 'TODO.md'
    poll_minutes: 5
    prompt: |
      There are {{CUE_TASK_COUNT}} pending tasks in {{CUE_TASK_FILE}}:

      {{CUE_TASK_LIST}}

      Pick the highest priority task and complete it.
      When done, check off the task in the file.

settings:
  timeout_minutes: 45
  max_concurrent: 2
  queue_size: 15
```

All four subscriptions appear as separate trigger lines within a single **DevOps** pipeline in the Pipeline Editor.
